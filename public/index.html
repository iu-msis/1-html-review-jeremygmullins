      <h3>About Me</h3>

      <br>

        <p>I was born on <strong>20th, 1987 in Dublin, Ireland</strong>  and <strong>I am 34 years old.</strong>  I
          grew up on the green hillsides. When I was 10 years old, my family
          moved to the middle of nowhere in Indiana for a job my dad took. A couple years later, for Christmas
          my parents bought me a guitar, and since then, I've just wanted to play guitar
          in a massive rock band.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>When I'm not rocking out on stage, I like to read. My favorite author is Kurt Vonnegut,
          but I also enjoy self-help books as well as Harry Potter. I know, not what you'd expect
          from a rockstar. My favorite book that I've read recently was Greenlights.
        </p>
        
        <br>

        <p>My favorite artists of all time is John Mayer. He's got great taste in guitars.
          My favorite album of his is Born and Raised, but Continuum and Sob Rock are right 
          there behind it.
        </p>
